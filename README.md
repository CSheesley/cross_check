# Cross-Check

Starter repository for the [Turing School](https://turing.io/) Cross-Check project.

Proposed project work division: 

Plan is for 2 people to work on an iteration, while the 3rd starts the next one alone with the rest to join after. 
Each iteration will be refactored as it gets completed. 


Iteration 1, Setup:                       Together
Iteration 2, Game Stats:                  
Iteration 3, League & Season Stats:        
Iteration 4, Team Stats:                  
Iteration 5, Season Stats
