# Cross-Check
by **Triple 'C'hamps** aka **The 'C' Suites**

This project is created by a group of three classmates while students at Turing School of Software & Design in 2019.

## Objective
The project uses CSV data from the NHL to analyze team performance for specific seasons and across all seasons (e.g., best performances, worst performers, and stats for individual teams). The ultimate goal is to create an Object Oriented Program using TDD, SRP classes, and algorithmic thinking to analyze large data as a group.

## Installation

## Testing
