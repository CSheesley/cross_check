Project: Cross-Check

Group Member Names: Corey, Chi, Carrie

Team Name: Triple Champs

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
- Inheritance and modules
- Practice refactoring
- Style - SRP focus
- REALLY do TDD
- Prioritize learning over completion - all teammembers can explain the code - everyone has growth
- Being able to work on different things at the same time - GIT FLOW


Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
- communicate well
- Corey - planner/worrier, committed
- Chi - demands! accountability, testing (edge specifically)
- Carrie - teacher, visualizer


How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:
- we plan so we can make sure we are prepared for issues
- organization skills mitigate lack of coding skills in a group environment
- visualization and TDD to keep us directed
- communication - allows us to make sure we're on the right track instead of building things up for a few days


Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?):
- Carrie & Chi - mornings
- Corey - evenings
- Can be available on weekends
- Create spreadsheet for work/workflow or put on readme
- Daily check-in in person (either during project worktime or at lunch)


Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?):
- COMMUNICATE
- slack each other if someone is going to be late
- Cutoff at 9pm - it's good to sleep


Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
- Chi - feeling uncomfortable in later iterations - goal is to feel comfortable
- Corey - struggles solving harder methods - practice conceptualizing, researching help instead of asking for it
- Carrie - git workflow can be messy - BETTER!


Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
- Together - Iteration 1
- Chi - hashes, stats
- Corey - hashes, rakefile
- Carrie - csv stuff


Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):
- NO WORKING ON THE MASTER
- naming branches well! ex. 2_method_name, 3_method_name (number is iteration)
- only PR when feature is done (can refactor later)
- lots of commits
- good commit messages
- positive PR feedback!


Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
- positivity!
- "feedback is the breakfast of champions"
- bring up typos immediately
- feedback after an iteration
- no false confidence; guideance is not personal


Project management tools we will use:
- spreadsheet
- Slack
- README
- save Waffle for later


Day 1 Agenda:
- create README
- Iteration 1 - setup the project well and make sure it is solid so we can move through Iterations 2-5.
